<h1>About Me</h1>
<p>
  I’m currently in the 5th semester of Computer Engineering at PUC Goiás, 
  and I’m passionate aboutdeveloping my skills in programming and 
  problem-solving. I have experience with several 
  programming languages, including C, C++, Java, Python, 
  and SQL, and I love applying what I learn to practical projects. 
  Some of my recent projects include working on hash tables, implementing an LRU cache, 
  and developing algorithms to solve challenges like checking if a string can be rearranged into a palindrome or
  if a letter can be constructed from a magazine.

<p>
  I’ve always been curious and motivated to 
  learn more about the underlying concepts in computer science, 
  which keeps me constantly pushing myself to improve. I really enjoy working on projects
  that combine theory and real-world application, and I try to learn something new every day.
  When I'm not coding, I like exploring different ways to express my creativity.

<p>
  I’m also someone who believes in both personal and 
  academic growth. I’ve been focusing on balancing my studies with self-reflection and improvement, 
  and I’m always open to new challenges that push me out of my comfort zone. With each passing semester, 
  I aim to refine my skills, expand my knowledge, and find ways to apply them in meaningful ways.
